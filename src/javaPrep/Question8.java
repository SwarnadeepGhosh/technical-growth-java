the smallest or the second smallest path to start the journey.
Write a logic to find the smallest and the second smallest distance
from the list of all distances.
Input :
1. The first Input contains N, the total number of paths from the source
to the destination.
2. The second input contains N sorted integers separated by a newline
A1,A2....An, representing the distance of all paths.
Output :
Output contains two numbers separated by a single space character.
If all paths are equal, then the system should generate a message as "Equal".
If N is less than 2, then the system should generate a message as "Invalid
Input".
Constrains
2 < N <= 10
1 <= A[i] <= 1000
