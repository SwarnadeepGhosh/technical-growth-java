Question:
In the amusement park at Looney's amusement, there is a "Weighted Maze"
challenge. This consist of a set of East West roads(referred to as left to
right roads) and North South roads (referred to as Up Down roads). Each
Intersection has a block of icon bar, the weight of which is given. You
enter the maze at the top left corner with 1Kg in cart. The exit from the
maze is at the bottom right corner. Movement at any intersection is to the
right or down provided a road exits in that direction.
At each intersection you pass through, you must exchange the weight in your
cart with the weight of the bar at the intersection if it is heavier than the
weight you have in the cart.
The objective is to determine a path through the maze along the roads so that
one can exit the maze with the minimum weight in the cart.
Input:
->The first line consists of a positive integer n, which is the number
of intersection in any up-down or left-right road.
->The next n lines each consist of n positive integers representing the
weights at the intersections in the corresponding left-right road.
Output:
A positive integer that represents the minimum weight possible in the cart
when exiting the maze.
Example:
input :
4
1 8 21 7
19 17 10 20
2 18 23 22
14 25 4 13
Output:
22
