/*
Question :
Bastin once had trouble finding the numbers in a string. The Numbers are
distributed in a string across various test cases. There are various numbers
in each test case you need to find only those numbers which do not contain 9.
For eg, If the string contains "hello this is alpha 5051 and 9475". You will
extract 5051 and not 9475. You need only those Numbers which are consecutive
and you need to help him to find the numbers. print the largest number.
Example 1:
Input:
This is alpha 5057 and 9741
output:
5057
Example 2:
Input:
dream job 100 and 101
